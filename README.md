# Employee management system
 
## Project Description
 
This project repository consists of a Flutter application made to manage an Employee system for any type of organisation. The idea of the project is that by
giving employees an identification to join the system so that it makes it easy for both the employee and the employer to manage their work for the organisation.
We tried to include the common application of any manual employment system provided by any organisation. So, the idea is simply digitalizing the backward employee
management system to a technologically supported system. The app is run as a demo on a local machine but it can be scaled to a product for any specific organisation
or company to integrate it in their own system and use an internet dependent or local server to run their database. The general structure of the application
is as follows:
- The top privilege is given to the administrator of the organisation. So that he can create a user for the application which will run under the
specific organisation rule. He can create a normal employee or he can also hire an employee as a manager. So, he has the privilege to give different
role for the users he creates. That means at the beginning of the application the only user that can access the app is the admin himself.
- After he create the users (add employees to the system), he will also send an invitation using their email accounts so that they can be
authenticated using their email and the password from their email invitations.
- After they are authenticated that means the system has an assurance they are an employee of the organisation, now they get the main front interface
of the application which will provide them the sign up and sign in page. So, since they are new users they sign up to the application. In the sign up
page they will fill out the basic information about themselves.
- After signing up to the app they can use the organisation's employee management system.
 
 
### Every user of the application have their own dashboards.
> 1. The employee dashboard consists of an attendance, a suggestion/request page, and a notification from the organisation. They can also delete and update their account from the system.
> 2. The manager's dashboard consists of a list of employees, an attendance checker, get a notification from the organisation, a request page, a page to view if he gets a request from an employee, he can promote an employee to another department.
> 3. The Admin dashboard consists of a list of all employees including the managers, a page to create and remove any kind of employee, he can change and also promote an employee, he will receive any request and also give a response to them, he can also add another admin to the system.
